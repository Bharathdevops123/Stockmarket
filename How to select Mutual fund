How to select a mutual fund:

1) First we need to check our Time Goal
(short term or medium term or long term)
Fundmanager Credibility
Standard Deviation: Represent Volatality (Lesser the Standard deviation better is the mutual fund)
Alpha: Performance with respect to index performance

My screening for Mutual fund:
----------------------------
Recent Performance: 5Years average > 25%
Bad time Performance: In bad time how did it performed: Example 2008 and 2020 (Corona)
Expense Ratio: less than 1 %
Exit Load: less than 1%


Small cap fund 
AUM <10000 cr because fundmanager can enter and exit easily

My portfolio
------------
Better:
Hybrid aggresive 
----------------
For Long term
This has Equity + Debt. If market is down the fund manager will increase the debt component. 
If market is up then he moves increases the Equity. To get Equity taxation he will play some arbitrage opprotunity.
Instead of Debt fund take Arbitrage fund - Equity taxation + high interest rates

ELSS
-----
To save Tax

Hybrid Arbitrage
-----------------
For short term less than a year
An exit load is levied if the fund is withdrawn within 30 or 60 days of buying.
